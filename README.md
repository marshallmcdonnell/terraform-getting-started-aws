# Terraform "Getting Started" for AWS

These are my scripts from going over Terraform's ["Getting Started"](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform#getting-started) via AWS EC2 instances

## Quickstart

0) [Install terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install)
1) Clone this repo
2) Initialize: 
  ```
  terraform init
  ```
3) Setup a way to authenicate with AWS via Terraform's [AWS provider docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html)
4) Review and apply changes to resources: 
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```
5) Tear down resources: 
    ```
    terraform destroy
    ```
